                    How to face life changing events
                </div>
                <div class="reflectionContent">
                        <p id="first">We all have had circumstances in our life that were “life changing events”. Some of these situations were negative, like loss of job, catastrophe to possessions such as home or cars, sickness or sudden death of loved ones. Some of these situations were positive such as job promotions, the birth of new family additions or financial gain. Good or bad all “life changing events” have one thing in common, the need for persistent action to make the adjustment. Matthew 7:7 reminds us of the path we can take when there are unexpected changes in life; “Ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find; knock and the door will be open to you.” </p>
                        <p id="second">Unexpected “life changing events” requires “personal change” to adapt and move forward. We need to ask for the necessary tools to adapt to a “life changes”, we should seek new direction to accommodate “life changes” and most of all when God opens a door, we need to be receptive to the direction, the newly opened door is taking us. With God, every adversity has an open door. When God allows adversity and pain in our lives, we are usually being guided to a door of “God’s Blessing”, that we never would have discovered without the adversity. </p>
                        <p id="third">Remember, in adversity or success, always knock on the door that God is leading you to and it will be opened. </p>

                                <p>God is Real. In our attempts to understand God, define God, make our worship of God meaningful to us, make God relevant to our individual problems and prove God’s existence, we lose the true meaning of his infinite goodness and control. He is and we will never fully understand. We live by faith, not by sight (2 Corinthians 5:7, NIV)</p>
